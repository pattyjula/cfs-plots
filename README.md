### Reviewing calls for service in Los Angeles City
#### Comparing 2019 and 2020

This repository seeks to begin answering the question of: how have calls for service changed in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic? Toward that end, calls for service in 2019 and 2020 are examined. This data is provided without warrenty, expressed or implied, of any kind.

Data, comprised of CSV files of Calls for Service by year, can be downloaded from LA Open Data (https://data.lacity.org/). It is too large to upload to this repo.

The Jupyter Notebook file(s) are found here in the ```code``` folder.
